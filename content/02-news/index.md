# News or Blog

You can add one or many news- or blog-sections to your website. Simply create a new folder and change the content of the folder from "pages" to "posts" in the meta-tab. You can also transform a folder with pages into a folder with posts and vice versa. The only difference between posts and pages is the sorting: Pages are sorted alphabetically, while posts are sorted by the publish date. Posts are visible as a list. They are not included in the navigation on the left side.
