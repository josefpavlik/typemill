# Create Your First Page

To create a new page in Typemill, follow these simple steps:

* Use the **interactive navigation** located on the left side of the screen. 
* **Enter a page title** for your new page into one of the grey input fields.
* **Click the page icon** to create a new page. You can also create a folder if you want to add sub-pages later.

Here's a quick breakdown of the options:

* **Folders**: Use folders to organize your website hierarchically. Folders can contain subfolders or pages. Unlike a traditional file system, folders in Typemill can also have content, similar to pages.
* **Pages**: Utilize pages for simple content without needing a deeper structure.

Additionally, you can rearrange your pages by dragging and dropping them within the navigation panel.
