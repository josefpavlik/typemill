# Edit the Page Meta

You can edit detailed meta-information by switching to the meta-tab at the top of the page. While most of the meta-information should be self-explanatory, let's delve into some details:

- **Slug**: This is the URL. Changing the slug will alter the URL, potentially affecting indexing in search engines like Google.
- **Navigation Title**: Change the title for the navigation.
- **Meta Content**: Modify standard meta-tags like title and description. The image will be used when pages are shared on social media platforms and may also appear in the frontend, depending on your theme.
- **Author**: The author will appear in the frontend (depending on the theme); the owner has the rights to edit the page.
- **Access Rights**: You can restrict access to the page in the frontend. See the example for an [restricted page here](/tm/content/visual/publish-status/restricted).
- **Date**: The date of creation, last publication, and a manually set date.
- **Reference**: You can create different references for a page, such as a redirect 301 or 302 to another page, copying another page, or linking the page to an external page. These features are demonstrated in the [pages status examples](tm/content/visual/publish-status).
- **Visibility**: Hide a page from the navigation and exclude it from the index with a noindex-tag. These features are demonstrated in the [pages status examples](tm/content/visual/publish-status).
