# Edit Your Page

Typemill uses [Markdown](https://typemill.net/writers/markdown) to create content. But don't worry: The visual editor of Typemill will help you write content in a WYSIWYG-style (what you see is what you get). You can also switch to the [raw-markdown-mode](/tm/content/raw/getting-started/edit-your-page) with the sticky 'raw' button located at the bottom right corner of the editor interface.

The content is organized in blocks, and you can move each content block up and down with drag & drop.

- **To edit** a content block, simply click on it.
- **To add** a new block at the end of the page, use the edit buttons below.
- **To add** a new block above this block, use the "add" button that appears when you hover over this block.

You can add all kinds of content like tables, quotes, images, files, an automatic table of contents (TOC), or YouTube videos. There are also plugins to embed media from other platforms or to use selected HTML tags in content.

If you are a developer, you can write plugins and integrate nearly everything into the editor with `{::]` shortcodes.
