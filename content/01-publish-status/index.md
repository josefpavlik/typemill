# Publish Status

In Typemill you can save drafts, publish pages, unpublish pages, and delete pages with a sticky publish panel at the bottom of each page. For published pages, you can also save modifications, discard modifications and publish modifications.

The current status of the page is indicated with colors in the publish panel and in the navigation. This way, an author can always see the status of each page and the current state of the whole website.
