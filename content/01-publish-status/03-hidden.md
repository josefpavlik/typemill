# Hidden Page

This is a hidden page. Hidden pages are published pages that are excluded from all navigation elements. You need to know the url to visit a hidden page. Hidden pages are great if you want to check your page in the frontend without beeing visible for visitors directly. Hidden pages are not excluded from the xml-sitemap and they do not have a noindex attribute.

You can hide pages with a checkbox in the meta-tab (sroll to the bottom).
