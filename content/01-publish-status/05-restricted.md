# Restricted Page

This is a restricted page (to activate the feature please read the paragraph below). Restricted pages are published pages that require an authentication to see the content. You can cut the content with a hr-line, everything below this line is not visible in frontend for unauthenticated users.

---

You can configure page restrictions in the system settings. Open the tab "restrictions" and choose the options. You can restrict the whole website or you can restrict certain pages. To restrict certain pages, go to the meta-tab of a page and scroll down to the section "Access & Rights". There you have two options:

* You can choose a userrole that should have access to the content.
* Or you can add one or several usernames who should have access to the content.
